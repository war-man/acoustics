{"name":"Acoustics","tagline":"A collection of acoustic utilities written in C#.","body":"# Modal Analysis\r\nPerforms a [modal analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_analysis) on an empty room, assuming flat walls.\r\n\r\n### Method\r\n1. Calculate the critical frequency of the given room:\r\n * Calculate the volume of the room.\r\n * Calculate the surface area of the room (4 walls + roof + floor, flat planes).\r\n * Calculate the [mean free path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path) (MFP).\r\n * Calculate the critical frequency.\r\n2. Calculate the fundamental axial modes for each axis\r\n * `f = v/2D`\r\n * Where `D = Axis length (m)` and `v = Speed of sound (m/s)`\r\n3. Calculate axial mode harmonics up to critical frequency\r\n4. Sort harmonics for all axes\r\n5. Find coincidences\r\n6. Find spacings\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n| Argument | Description    | Type   | Unit  | Optional             |\r\n|----------|----------------|--------|-------|----------------------|\r\n| -l       | Room length    | Double | Hertz | No                   |\r\n| -w       | Room width     | Double | Hertz | No                   |\r\n| -h       | Room height    | Double | Hertz | No                   |\r\n| -v       | Speed of sound | Double | m/s   | Yes (default 344m/s) |","google":"UA-60758177-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
